The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

		<p>Harry Potter starts out as a friendly and curious child. He gets to know people who become very close to him. His two best friends, Ron and Hermione, and his godfather, Sirius Black, help and care about him. ... He risks his own life and in the end he defeats Voldemort, sees a friend die, and gets by with a narrow escape
			<br>
			Harry also had the unusual ability to speak and understand "Parseltongue", a language associated with Dark Magic. This, it transpires, is because he harbours a piece of Voldemort's soul. He loses this ability after the part of Voldemort's soul inside him is destroyed at the end of The Deathly Hallows.
